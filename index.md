# Design and Analysis of Algorithms
Design Analysis of Algorithms is a course focused on the study of nature through the lens of algorithms. The course emphasises finding solutions to complex problems by intuitively observing and understanding the workings of natural elements and how they were developed historically.

We often hear that today's world is data-driven, and we need better management of data, but this has always been true since the dawn of humanity. The desire to group data, represent and make sense of it gave rise to data structures. As part of the course and outside of it, we have come across data structures (in the way of evolution) such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, n-nary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, tries, queries, look-up table, sparse table, skip list, graphs, and many more.

The other part of the course deals with algorithms, which essentially boil a problem down to an instruction set that gives appropriate outputs for its defined use case. Some such algorithms that we came across are sequential search, brave and cautious travel, backtracking, sorting techniques (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap), string algorithms (Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp, rolling hash), union/disjoint sets, and shortest path algorithms (Floyd-Warshall, Prim's)


The course assignments and projects are in-line with real-world applications or at least mock-ups of the real-time application, discussing the use of each data structure and algorithm in the real-world scenario discussing its shortcomings and much more. For example, Submission throttling was discussed as a part of trie data structure, We were asked to wisely choose the data structure to build a recommendation engine and a localized, faster user-defined heap memory. The world currently, needs engineers who can build efficient algorithms or optimize the existing algorithms to perform better, This course builds the intuition to build better algorithms and also the proper approach to understand the existing ones.

The project started when we received the initial need statement from our course instructor:

        Surrounded by a human habitat, there is an area of 1500 square kilometres that the government of India wants to convert into a smart city. Government is also cautious from the failed cities like Lavasa and Masdar etc. Prepare a city plan proposal for the government. 
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify;">
        Proposal must include a city layout plan, budget, revenue models, sustainability, human population, and all other supporting relevant information.

# Overview
Thomas Wayne's vision in the DC Comics transformed the fictional city of Gotham into a cutting-edge metropolis. Unfortunately, after his death, the city saw its downfall. Drawing lessons from such stories and realities such as the failed cities of Lavasa and Masdar, We propose a smart city - Goutham.

We plan to build this city by connecting and enhancing the existing cities of Dahod, Limdi, Singwad, Fatepura, Santroad, Piplod, Golav, Ruvabari, and others as shown in the map. The existing towns and cities will retain their respective name but will fall under the governance of Goutham and will be called a part of it. The regionâ€™s demands for the development and recognition of local culture will be given a stage efforts will be made to meet these demands.

Goutham is a 1,500 sq.km sustainable, technologically advanced centre built on the Chota Udaipur Hills and the Gujarat plains, it experiences a moderate climate with gentle temperature fluctuations throughout the year. It also experiences moderate to heavy rainfall of about 1200mm per year. Local lakes and reservoirs are the city's main water supply.
