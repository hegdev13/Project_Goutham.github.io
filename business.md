# Bussiness Use Cases 
###### Vishruth G H 
### 1. Bus Scheduling:
Frequent bus scheduling - The city of Goutham, although well connected by multiple modes of transport, heavily depends on its public bus services. Infrequent and poorly scheduled bus services would lead to overcrowding and an unsatisfied user base. A good design for such a system is required.

### 2. Mining: 
Deposits of Mica, Graphite and Quartz mineral ores have been identified near the city's outskirts (close to Damod). These ores can be mined and transported to Goutham's industrial area for further processing using the robust railway, creating a valuable supply chain for industrial use.

### 3. Agriculture:
The region's soil is suitable for cultivating groundnuts, jowar, and rice. Trading these resources could be highly profitable. Establishing connections between farmers and the right merchants could further enhance trade profitability.

The Goutham city is a city in Gujarat.
Gujarat is considered to be the epicenter for industries & startups in India.
Reasons behind this trend are multifold:

1- Gujarat has historically been a center for business as it has ports which aid international cargo commutes and export. These trade activities contribute to the economy of Gujarat.

2- Initiatives by state as well as central government contribute to the growth of the economy of Gujarat.
Ex: SEZs: Special Economic Zones. SEZs are special areas where business and trade rules are different from the rest of the country.
SEZs aim to build an environment which attracts foreign as well as domestic investors to come and invest in Gujarat and set up manufacturing units and industries.

Increased industries and manufacturing units give birth to the need for increased demand for energy. Clean and uninterrupted power.

To solve this problem, Goutham city, along with the state government, has invested in an ELECTRICITY PARK situated on a large piece of land on the outskirts of the city, with land covered with solar panels and windmills.

Fun Fact: Gujarat has the highest installed wind power capacity in the country after Tamil Nadu.

FEATURES

a// The Electricity Park model aims to provide clean energy to the industries situated in the industrial area of Goutham city. Overhead power is used to provide energy to commercial areas.

b// Although the municipality/State Government encourages citizens to install solar panels in their houses, this reduces the load on the Municipality, which in turn reduces the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity.

Goutham has a culture of renewable energy. This model to promote the generation and usage of green energy inspires neighboring cities/States also.



 



////////////////////// E-RICKSHAWs/E-TAXIs ////////////////////// 


Goutham city has 2 railway stations, which are mainly used to commute goods for industries, or for intra-city or long-distance journeys.

///THEN WHAT ABOUT INTER-CITY TRAVEL? ///

Mumbai Model
Mumbai city has a very popular trend of local trains, which serve millions of people every day and help them commute from their homes to workplaces, offices, educational institutions, and more.

Though Mumbai does have a metro, like other cities such as Delhi, Chennai, and Bangalore, Mumbai Local remains people's daily choice due to its cheap fares and enormous connectivity across the city.

Delhi Model
There are a total of 288 metro stations under Delhi Metro, the highest in the country. This number is astonishing. Metro lines in Delhi are spread across the capital, covering almost all parts of it, which explains the number of stations.

Unlike Delhi or Mumbai, Goutham city has only 3 metro lines, which obviously do not cover the whole city like Delhi. YES, the metro in Goutham doesn't cover the entire city.

///THEN WHAT ABOUT INTER-CITY TRAVEL? ///

Goutham-Metro is designed to efficiently connect the city's key areas, including both IT parks, the railway stations, the industrial zone, the administrative hub, the airport, and the outskirts of residential areas, ensuring seamless transit to all prominent locations.

///THEN WHAT ABOUT INTER-CITY TRAVEL TO THE AREAS NOT EXCLUSIVELY COVERED BY THE METRO? ///

E-Rickshaw/E-Taxi
Goutham city has developed a Smart/Sustainable-Travel Model to make inter-city commute affordable, clean, easier, and more sustainable.

To achieve this:
Goutham city promotes E-rickshaws and E-taxis on roads and encourages citizens to opt for these GREEN TAXIS.

Goutham city provides subsidies and loan facilities for the purchase of E-taxis or E-rickshaws, which also provide an opportunity for poor people to create a source of income for themselves.

Goutham municipality has restricted commercial public transport running on fossil fuels from operating on roads.

The city has invested in infrastructure to aid E-travel:
a. Special E-rickshaw stands.
b. Special zones near all metro stations for E-taxis/E-rickshaws.
c. The government has installed charging stations at all these stands and zones.

The Goutham-Metro lines act as the skeleton, whereas the E-rickshaws and E-taxis serve as the arteries and veins of the travel model of Goutham.
