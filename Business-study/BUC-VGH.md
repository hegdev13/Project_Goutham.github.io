# Business Use Case
###### Vishruth G H


## Food Production and Distribution
A sustainable city relies heavily on efficient food production, management, and distribution systems. The region's fertile soil is well-suited for cultivating crops such as groundnuts, jowar, and rice. These crops not only fulfil the city's food requirements but also create significant trade opportunities due to their high demand.
Goutham's strategic location provides access to regional and national markets, enhancing trade and diversifying resources. Trade also helps establish connections between farmers and merchants, which can help optimise the sector for better profitability and sustained growth.
Efficient food distribution systems ensure that locally sourced vegetables and grains are delivered to restaurants, marketplaces, shelters, camps, and educational institutes across the city. This not only promotes food security and well-being but also minimizes the environmental footprint by reducing transportation costs and emissions. Supporting local agriculture strengthens the community while reinforcing Gouthamâ€™s commitment to sustainability and economic resilience.

Let's decompose this into smaller use cases and work each one out.

# Some other business use cases identified: 
### 1. Bus Scheduling:
Frequent bus scheduling - The city of Goutham, although well connected by multiple modes of transport, heavily depends on its public bus services. Infrequent and poorly scheduled bus services would lead to overcrowding and an unsatisfied user base. A good design for such a system is required.

### 2. Mining: 
Deposits of Mica, Graphite and Quartz mineral ores have been identified near the city's outskirts (close to Damod). These ores can be mined and transported to Goutham's industrial area for further processing using the robust railway, creating a valuable supply chain for industrial use.

### 3. City cleaning Maintenance
City cleaning, maintenance, proper garbage disposal, and efficiently segregating recyclable, non-recyclable, biodegradable, and other kinds of waste. A clean city invites more people, which increases the commercial activities of the city. 


### 4. Medical health camp
health checkups at lower prices for specific regions. Hospitals need to coordinate and circulate this responsibility, covering the entire city.
