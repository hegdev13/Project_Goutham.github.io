# Integrated Business Case Study for Goutham Region

## Overview

  The Goutham city and its surrounding villages offer varying opportunities to create sustainable business models.
  The traditional skills, cultural heritage, and available resources can be utilized for betterment of our city.
  I propose a unified business strategy that involves skill development, women’s empowerment, local craftsmanship, and industrial growth.
  By aligning these case ideas with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the development of the local is ensured.

## Unified Business Case:

  ### Skill Development:

  Build new centers to train citizens in traditional agriculture methods, forest product collection techniques, and craftsmanship skills.
  Provide training about digital world, basics of entrepreneurship, and industrial roles.

### Empowering Women:

  Develop industries such as textiles that require women’s skills in embroidery and crafts.
  Offer work and leadership opportunities for women of rural communities, who are usually unemployed.

### Promoting Local Craftsmanship:

  Set up small scale industries for bamboo crafts, wood carvings, and embroidery as the locale are expert in it.
  Build e-commerce platforms to promote and sell the products over the nation.

### Industrial Growth:

  Upgrade the exisiting Dahod railway workshop to a locomotive and coach manufacturing facility.
  Utilize barren land (around 13%-15%) for this facility.
