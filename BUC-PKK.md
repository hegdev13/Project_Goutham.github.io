1. E-RICKSHAWs/E-TAXIs
Goutham city has 2 railway stations, which are mainly used to commute goods for industries, or for intra-city or long-distance journeys.

(1)INTER-CITY TRAVEL
Mumbai Model Mumbai city has a very popular trend of local trains, which serve millions of people every day and help them commute from their homes to workplaces, offices, educational institutions, and more.

Though Mumbai does have a metro, like other cities such as Delhi, Chennai, and Bangalore, Mumbai Local remains people's daily choice due to its cheap fares and enormous connectivity across the city.

Delhi Model There are a total of 288 metro stations under Delhi Metro, the highest in the country. This number is astonishing. Metro lines in Delhi are spread across the capital, covering almost all parts of it, which explains the number of stations.

Unlike Delhi or Mumbai, Goutham city has only 3 metro lines, which obviously do not cover the whole city like Delhi. YES, the metro in Goutham doesn't cover the entire city.

(3) INTRA-CITY TRAVEL
Goutham-Metro is designed to efficiently connect the city's key areas, including both IT parks, the railway stations, the industrial zone, the administrative hub, the airport, and the outskirts of residential areas, ensuring seamless transit to all prominent locations.

(4) INTRA-CITY TRAVEL TO THE AREAS NOT EXCLUSIVELY COVERED BY THE METRO?
E-Rickshaw/E-Taxi Goutham city has developed a Smart/Sustainable-Travel Model to make inter-city commute affordable, clean, easier, and more sustainable.

To achieve this: Goutham City promotes E-rickshaws and E-taxis on roads and encourages citizens to opt for these GREEN TAXIS.

Goutham City provides subsidies and loan facilities for the purchase of E-taxis or E-rickshaws, which also provide an opportunity for poor people to create a source of income for themselves.

Goutham municipality has restricted commercial public transport running on fossil fuels from operating on roads.

The city has invested in infrastructure to aid E-travel: a. Special E-rickshaw stands. b. Special zones near all metro stations for E-taxis/E-rickshaws. c. The government has installed charging stations at all these stands and zones.

The Goutham-Metro lines act as the skeleton, whereas the E-rickshaws and E-taxis serve as the arteries and veins of the travel model of Goutham.


//////////SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ALIGNMENTS//////////


The above identified business case study relates to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and works towards attaining them:

SDG No. 11: Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable

    11.2: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport.
    The initiative to populate Goutham's roads with electric-run public vehicles aligns with this target. The fact that these vehicles do not contribute to pollution and actively work towards maintaining and improving the environment is commendable.

    11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.
    The government's promotion of electric vehicles and restrictions on fuel-powered vehicles reduce the adverse effects of fossil fuel emissions, significantly improving air quality.

SDG No. 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all

    The municipality's initiative to promote electric vehicles inspires the public to support the shift towards sustainable energy.
    The establishment of charging stations around the city ensures access to modern and sustainable energy for powering vehicles, directly supporting this SDG.


SDG No. 8: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and      productive employment, and decent work for all

    Encouraging the adoption of E-vehicles creates employment opportunities in the green mobility sector.
    This model generates jobs for drivers, technicians, and maintenance staff, promoting inclusive economic growth and decent work opportunities.



///////////PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED/////////

(1) A record of all the electric vehicles that are running as public transport on the roads needs to be kept.

Since the city is in GUJARAT state, the registration number plate configuration is like 'GJ XX XXXX'.
Since there are so many vehicles on the roads, the municipality wants to keep them in a sorted manner. The municipality wishes to sort them on the basis of the last four digits of the registration plate.

SOLUTION: MERGE SORT can be used to sort them in the order.

//

CODE FOR MERGE SORT

//

(2) In this large database of registration plates, the municipality has the name of an owner of a vehicle and wants to find out all the details of the owner and their vehicle. The municipality needs a way to search for that name and display all the details based on it.

//

CODE FOR RABIN KARP STRING SEARCH ALGORITHM

//


(3) Since the public vehicles are traveling from one point to another in the city, the municipality needs to develop a layout for the major destinations of the city. This layout should cover all the locations with the shortest paths. This will help vehicle drivers navigate better, take paths that are cheaper, and avoid unnecessarily longer routes (MINIMUM SPANNING TREE IS REQUIRED).

//THE ORHER IDENTIFIED BUSINESS CASE STUDY//



2. Electricity Park
The Goutham city is a city in Gujarat. Gujarat is considered to be the epicenter for industries & startups in India. Reasons behind this trend are multifold:

1- Gujarat has historically been a center for business as it has ports which aid international cargo commutes and export. These trade activities contribute to the economy of Gujarat.

2- Initiatives by state government contribute to the growth of the economy of Gujarat. Ex: SEZs: Special Economic Zones. SEZs aim to build an environment which attracts foreign as well as domestic investors to come and invest in Gujarat and set up manufacturing units and industries.

Increased industries and manufacturing units give birth to the need for increased demand for energy. Clean and uninterrupted power.

To solve this problem, Goutham city has invested in an ELECTRICITY PARK situated on a large piece of land on the outskirts of the city, with land covered with solar panels and windmills.

Fun Fact: Gujarat has the highest installed wind power capacity in the country after Tamil Nadu.

Goutham has a culture of renewable energy. This model to promote the generation and usage of green energy inspires neighboring cities/States also.
